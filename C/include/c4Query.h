    /** Creates a database index, of the values of specific expressions across all documents.
        The name is used to identify the index for later updating or deletion; if an index with the
        same name already exists, it will be replaced unless it has the exact same expressions.

        Currently two types of indexes are supported:

        * Value indexes speed up queries by making it possible to look up property (or expression)
          values without scanning every document. They're just like regular indexes in SQL or N1QL.
          Multiple expressions are supported; the first is the primary key, second is secondary.
          Expressions must evaluate to scalar types (boolean, number, string).
        * Full-Text Search (FTS) indexes enable fast search of natural-language words or phrases
          by using the `MATCH` operator in a query. A FTS index is **required** for full-text
          search: a query with a `MATCH` operator will fail to compile unless there is already a
          FTS index for the property/expression being matched. Only a single expression is
          currently allowed, and it must evaluate to a string.
        * Array indexes optimize UNNEST queries, by materializing an unnested array property
          (across all documents) as a table in the SQLite database, and creating a SQL index on it.

        Note: If the value of an expression in some document is missing or an unsupported type,
        that document will just be omitted from the index. It's not an error.

        Expressions are defined in JSON, as in a query, and wrapped in a JSON array. For example,
        `[[".name.first"]]` will index on the first-name property. Note the two levels of brackets,
        since an expression is already an array.

        Currently, full-text indexes are limited to a single expression only.

        In an array index, the first expression must be a property path: this references the array
        to be unnested. If the array items are nonscalar (dictionaries or arrays), you should add
        a second expression defining the sub-property (or computed value) to index, relative to the
        array item.

        Geospatial indexes are not implemented at all yet.

        @param database  The database to index.
        @param name  The name of the index. Any existing index with the same name will be replaced,
                     unless it has the identical expressions (in which case this is a no-op.)
        @param expressionsJSON  A JSON array of one or more expressions to index. Each expression
                     takes the same form as in a query, which means it's a JSON array as well;
                     don't get mixed up by the nesting!
        @param indexType  The type of index (value or full-text.)
        @param indexOptions  Options for the index. If NULL, each option will get a default value.
        @param outError  On failure, will be set to the error status.
        @return  True on success, false on failure. */
