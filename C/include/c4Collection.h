/** \defgroup Collection Collections
    @{
    A `C4Collection` represents a **Collection**, a named grouping of documents in a database.
    You can think of them as "folders" or "directories" for documents, or as like tables.

    Each Collection provides:
    - a namespace for documents (a "docID" is only unique within its Collection)
    - a queryable container, named in `FROM` and `JOIN` clauses.
    - a scope for indexes
    - a scope for document enumerators
    - independent sequence numbers

    Every database starts with a **default Collection**, whose name is `_default`. If the database
    was created by an earlier version of LiteCore, all existing documents will be in the default
    Collection.

    Pre-existing functions that refer to documents / sequences / indexes without referring to
    Collections -- such as \ref c4doc_get and \ref c4db_getLastSequence -- still exist, but implicitly
    operate on the default Collection. In other words, they behave exactly the way they used to,
    but Collection-aware code should avoid them and use the new Collection API instead.
    These functions will eventually be deprecated, then removed.

    > **NOTE:** A few Collection functions are documented in other sections of the API docs:

    - Enumeration-related functions (in `c4DocEnumerator.h`):
      - \ref c4coll_enumerateChanges
      - \ref c4coll_enumerateAllDocs
    - Observer-related functions (in `c4Observer.h`):
      - \ref c4dbobs_createOnCollection
      - \ref c4docobs_createWithCollection
