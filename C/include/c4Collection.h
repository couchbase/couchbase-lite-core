/** \defgroup Collection Collections and Scopes
    @{
    A `C4Collection` represents a **Collection**, a named grouping of documents in a database.
    You can think of them as "folders" or "directories" for documents, or as SQL tables.

    Each Collection provides:
    - a namespace for documents (a "docID" is only unique within its Collection)
    - a queryable container, named in `FROM` and `JOIN` clauses.
    - a scope for indexes
    - a scope for document enumerators
    - independent sequence numbers

    Likewise, a **Scope** is a grouping of Collections, like a "parent folder".

    Every database starts with a **default Collection**, whose name is `_default`, which exists in
    a **default Scope**, also named `_default`. If the database was created by an earlier version
    of LiteCore, all existing documents will be in the default Collection.

    ## Collection Naming
    In this API, collections are named by a \ref C4CollectionSpec struct, which simply contains two
    `FLString`s, first a collection name and second a scope name. Note that the collection name
    comes first (unlike in a N1QL query), so that the scope name can be left out if you're
    referring to the default scope. You can give a collection spec literally as e.g.
    `{C4STR("mycoll")}`, or with a scope, `{C4STR("mycoll"), C4STR("myscope")}`.

    There are no API calls to create or delete Scopes. A Scope is created implicitly when you create
    the first Collection inside it, and deleted implicitly when you delete its last Collection.

    ## Legacy `C4Database` Functions
    Pre-existing functions that refer to documents / sequences / indexes without referring to
    Collections -- such as \ref c4doc_get and \ref c4db_getLastSequence -- still exist, but implicitly
    operate on the default Collection. In other words, they behave exactly the way they used to,
    but Collection-aware code should avoid them and use the new Collection API instead.

    These functions will eventually be deprecated, then removed. As an aid in updating your code,
    you can define the C preprocessor symbol `C4_STRICT_COLLECTION_API` to suppress the definitions
    of those functions, which will turn all calls to them into errors.

    ## `C4Collection` Lifespan
     `C4Collection` is ref-counted, but most of the time you don't need to retain or release it.
    The `C4Database` owns its collections, so a `C4Collection` reference remains valid until either
    the database is closed, or that collection is deleted. At that point it becomes a dangling
    pointer :( If you keep a collection reference long-term, you should retain it so that the
    reference remains valid until you release it.

    A retained C4Collection _object_ still becomes invalid after it's deleted or its database
    closes. After that, most operations on it will fail (safely), returning \ref kC4ErrorNotOpen
    or some null/zero result. You can tell whether a C4Collection is valid by calling
    \ref c4coll_isValid, or by checking whether \ref c4coll_getDatabase returns non-NULL.

    ## Other Documentation
    A few Collection functions are documented in other sections of the API docs:

    - Enumeration-related functions (in `c4DocEnumerator.h`):
      - \ref c4coll_enumerateChanges
      - \ref c4coll_enumerateAllDocs
    - Observer-related functions (in `c4Observer.h`):
      - \ref c4dbobs_createOnCollection
      - \ref c4docobs_createWithCollection */
