        CAUTION: This callback is called when a transaction is committed, even one made by a
        different connection (C4Database instance) on the same file. This means that, if your
        application is multithreaded, the callback may be running on a different thread than the
        one this database instance uses. It is your responsibility to ensure thread safety.

        In general, it is best to make _no_ LiteCore calls from within this callback. Instead,
        use your platform event-handling API to schedule a later call from which you can read the
        changes. Since this callback may be invoked many times in succession, make sure you
        schedule only one call at a time.

        @param observer  The observer that initiated the callback.
