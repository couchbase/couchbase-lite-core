Couchbase Mobile 2.0 Replication Protocol
-----------------------------------------

Jens Alfke — June 2017

Protocol version 1.2

This document specifies the new replication protocol in development for
Couchbase Mobile 2.0. It supersedes the REST-based protocol inherited
from CouchDB.

Benefits of the new protocol are:

* Faster and uses less bandwidth
* Consumes fewer TCP ports on the server (a limited resource)
* Opens a single TCP connection on the client instead of 4+ -- this
prevents problems with the limited number of sockets the client HTTP
library will open, which has led to deadlocks and performance problems
* Cleaner error handling, because socket-level connectivity errors only
happen on one socket instead of intermittently affecting some fraction
of requests
* Fully IANA compliant sparkly pony hooves (just checking to see if
anyone is reading this)
* Can be adapted to run over alternate transports like Bluetooth, or
anything else we can send framed messages over
* Less code (about 40% less in the iOS implementation)
* Cleaner implementation, with the generic messaging layer separated
from the replication-specific logic
* Protocol is inherently symmetric between client/server, which means
the two roles share a lot of common code
* Supports “conflict-free” servers, which require clients to resolve
conflicts before pushing changes.

[[architecture]]
1. Architecture
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The new replication protocol is built on the multiplexed
https://github.com/couchbaselabs/BLIP-Cocoa/blob/master/Docs/BLIP%20Protocol.md[BLIP
messaging protocol], which itself is layered on WebSockets. The relevant
aspects of the transport are:

* Communication runs over a single socket.
* Both client and server can send *messages*. The protocol is
symmetrical.
* Message delivery is reliable and ordered.
* Messages are multiplexed -- any number can be in flight at once, and a
large message does not block the ones behind it.
* A message is similar to an HTTP request in that it contains an
unlimited-size binary body plus a set of key/value properties.
* An unsolicited message is called a *request*.
* A request can be responded to (unless marked as no-reply) and the
*response* message can contain either properties and a body, or an
error.

Other transport protocols could be used under the hood in some
circumstances, for example Bluetooth, as long as the message semantics
are preserved.

[[connecting]]
2. Connecting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The client opens a WebSocket connection to the server at path
`/`__dbname__`/_blipsync` (where _dbname_ is the name of the database.)
This begins as an HTTP GET request, and goes through authentication as
usual, then upgrades to WebSocket protocol.

The WebSocket sub-protocol name "BLIP" (as sent in the
`Sec-WebSocket-Protocol` header) is used to ensure that both client and
server understand BLIP.

[[message-types]]
3. Message Types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A request's type is identified by its `Profile` property. The following
subsections are named after the `Profile` value of the request. Each
section begins by listing other defined properties and any meaning
assigned to the message body.

Any response properties and/or body data are listed too. However, many
messages don't require any data in the response, just a success/failure
indication.

Most of these messages are sent by both client and server. Their usage
in the replication algorithm is described in the *Algorithm* section
below.

[[getcheckpoint]]
getCheckpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`client`: Unique ID of client checkpoint to retrieve

Retrieves a checkpoint stored on the receiver. The checkpoint is a JSON
object that's stored as the value of the key given by the `client`
property.

Response:

`rev`: The MVCC revision ID of the checkpoint +
Body: JSON data of the checkpoint

[[setcheckpoint]]
setCheckpoint
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`client`: Unique ID of client checkpoint to store +
`rev`: Last known MVCC revision ID of the checkpoint _(omitted if this
is a new checkpoint)_ +
Body: JSON data of checkpoint

Stores a checkpoint on the receiver. The JSON object in the request body
is associated with the key given in the `client` property. If the `rev`
value does not match the checkpoint's current MVCC revision ID, the
request fails. On success, a new revision ID is generated and returned
in the response for use in the next request.

Response:

`rev`: New MVCC revision ID of the checkpoint

[[subchanges]]
subChanges
^^^^^^^^^^

`since`: Latest sequence ID already known to the requestor, JSON-encoded
_(optional)_ +
`continuous`: Set to `true` if the requestor wants change notifications
to be sent indefinitely _(optional)_ +
`filter`: The name of a filter function known to the recipient
_(optional)_ +
`batch`: Maximum number of changes to send in a single `change` message
_(optional)_ +
_other properties_: Named parameters for the filter function
_(optional)_ +
Body: JSON dictionary _(optional)_

Asks the recipient to begin sending change messages starting from the
sequence just after the one given by the `since` property, or from the
beginning if no `since` is given.

Note: A sequence ID can be any type of JSON value, so the `since`
property MUST be JSON-encoded. In particular, if the sequence ID is a
string, it MUST have quotes and any necessary escape characters added.

The changes are _not_ sent as a response to this request, rather as a
series of `changes` messages, each containing information about zero or
more changes. These are sent in chronological order.

Once all the existing changes have been sent, the end is signaled via an
empty `changes` message. Ordinarily, that will be the last message sent.
However, if the `continuous` property was set in the `subChanges`
request, the recipient will continue to send `changes` messages as new
changes are made to its database, until the connection is closed.

The optional `filter` parameter names a filter function known to the
recipient that limits which changes are sent. If this is present, any
other properties to the request will be passed as parameters to the
filter function. The Sync Gateway only recognizes the filter
`sync_gateway/bychannel`, which requires the parameter `channels` whose
value is a comma-delimited set of channel names.

If a request body is present, it MUST be a JSON dictionary/object. In
this dictionary the key `docIDs` MAY appear; its value MUST be an array
of strings. If present, the recipient MUST only send changes to
documents with IDs appearing in that array. Other unrecognized keys in
the dictionary MUST be ignored.

[[changes]]
changes
^^^^^^^

Body: JSON array

Notifies the recipient of a series of changes made to the sender's
database. A passive replicator (like Sync Gateway) is triggered to send
these by a prior `subChanges` request sent by the client. An active
replicator (Couchbase Lite) will send them spontaneously as part of a
push replication.

The changes are encoded in the message body as a JSON array with one
item per change. There can be zero or more changes; a messages with zero
changes signifies that delivery has "caught up" and all existing
sequences have been sent. This may be followed by more changes as they
occur, if the replication is continuous.

Each change in the array is encoded as a nested array of the form
`[sequence, docID, revID, deleted]`, i.e. sequence ID followed by
document ID followed by revision ID followed by the deletion state
(which can be omitted if it's `false`.)

The sequence IDs MUST be in forward chronological order but are
otherwise opaque (and may be any JSON data type.)

The document body size (in bytes) MAY be appended to the array as a
fifth item if it's known. This is understood to be approximate, since
the sender's database may not store the body in exactly the same form
that will be transmitted.

The sender SHOULD break up its change history into multiple `changes`
messages instead of sending them in one big message. (It SHOULD honor
the optional `batch` parameter in the `subChanges` request it received
from the peer.) It SHOULD use flow control by limiting the number of
`changes` messages that it's sent but not received replies to yet.

A peer in conflict-free mode SHOULD reject a received `changes` message
by returning a BLIP/409 error. This informs the sender that it should
use `proposeChanges` instead.

LiteCore always uses the `proposeChanges` endpoint rather than `changes`;
If LiteCore pushed a conflict via the `changes` endpoint, it would end up 
pulling in the other branch of the conflict soon thereafter, and CBL 
would resolve it and push the merge.

Response:

`maxHistory`: Max length of revision history to send _(optional)_ +
Body: JSON array (see below)

The response message indicates which revisions the recipient wants to
receive (as `rev` messages). Its body is also a JSON array; each item
corresponds to the revision at the same index in the request. The item
is either:

* an array of strings, where each string is the revision ID of an
already-known ancestor. (This may be empty if no ancestors are known.)
This is used to shorten the revision history to be sent with the
document, and may in the future be used to enable delta compression.
* or a `0` (zero) or `null` value, indicating that the corresponding
revision isn't of interest.

Trailing zeros or nulls can be omitted from the response array, so in
the simplest case the response can be an empty array `[]` if the
recipient isn't interested in any of the revisions.

The `maxHistory` response property, if present, indicates the maximum
length of the `history` array to be sent in `rev` messages (see below.)
It should be set to the maximum revision-tree depth of the database. If
it's missing, the history length is unlimited.

[[proposechanges]]
proposeChanges
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Body: JSON array

Sends proposed changes to a server that’s in conflict-free mode. This is
much like `changes` except that the items in the body array are
different; they look like `[docID, revID, serverRevID]`. Each still
represents an updated document, but the information sent is the
documentID, the current revisionID, and the revisionID of the last known
server revision (if any). If there is no known server revision, the
`serverRevID` SHOULD be omitted, or otherwise MUST be an empty string.
(As with `changes`, the estimated body size MAY be appended, if the
`serverRevID` is present.)

The recipient SHOULD then look through each document in its database. If
the document exists, but the given serverRevID is not known or not
current, the proposed document SHOULD be rejected with a 409 status (see
below.) Or if the document exists and the revID is current, the server
already has the document and SHOULD reject it with a 304 status. The
recipient MAY also detect other problems, such as an illegal document
ID, or a lack of write access to the document, and send back an
appropriate status code as described below.

Response:

Body: JSON array

The response message indicates which of the proposed changes are allowed
and which are out of date. It consists of an array of numbers, generally
with the same meanings as HTTP status codes, with the following specific
meanings: * 0: The change is allowed and the peer should send the
revision * 304: The server already has this revision, so the peer
doesn't need to send it * 409: This change would cause a conflict, so
the server needs to resolve it and retry later

As with `changes`, trailing zeros can be omitted, but the interpretation
is different since a zero means "send it" instead of "don’t send it". So
the common case of an empty array response tells the sender to _send_
all of the proposed revisions.

[[rev]]
rev
^^^

`id`: Document ID _(optional)_ +
`rev`: Revision ID _(optional)_ +
`deleted`: true if the revision is a tombstone _(optional)_ +
`sequence`: Sequence ID, JSON-encoded _(optional unless unsolicited,
q.v.)_ +
`history`: Revision history (comma-delimited list of revision IDs) +
Body: Document JSON

Sends one document revision. The `id`, `rev`, `deleted` properties are
optional if corresponding `_id`, `_rev`, `_deleted` properties exist in
the JSON body (and vice versa.) The `sequence` property is optional
unless this message was unsolicited.

A recipient in conflict-free mode will check whether the `history` array
contains the current local revision ID, or if the `history` array is
empty and the document does not exist locally. If not, it MUST reject
the revision by returning a 409 status.

Ordinarily a `rev` message is triggered by a prior response to a
`changes` message. However, it MAY be sent unsolicited, _instead_ of in
a `changes` message, if all of the following are true:

* This revision's metadata hasn't yet been sent in a `changes` message;
* this revision's sequence is the first one that hasn't yet been sent in
a `changes` message;
* the revision's JSON body is small;
* and the sender believes it's very likely that the recipient will want
this revision (doesn't have it yet and is not filtering it out.)

In practice this is most likely to occur for brand new changes being
sent in a continuous replication in response to a local database update
notification.

The recipient MUST send a response unless the request was sent
'noreply'. It MUST not send a success response until it has durably
added the revision to its database, or has failed to add it. On success
the response can be empty; on failure it MUST be an error.

Note: The recipient may need to send one or more `getattach` messages
while processing the `rev` message, in which case it MUST NOT send the
`rev`'s response until it's received responses to the `getattach`
message(s) and durably added the attachments, as well as the document,
to its database.


[[norev]]
norev
^^^^^

`id`: Document ID _(optional)_ +
`rev`: Revision ID _(optional)_ +
`sequence`: Sequence ID, JSON-encoded _(optional)_ +
`error`: The error number, which should correspond to HTTP Response status codes +
`reason`: A more detailed description of the cause of the error _(optional)_
Body: None

In the case a rev is requested from a peer via a `changes` response,
but that revision is not available, the `norev` message should be sent 
as a placeholder to inform the `peer` that there will be no corresponding 
`rev` message sent for the requested revision.  This prevents the peer 
from waiting for a `rev` message that will never come, which could cause 
the replication to get stuck.


[[getattachment]]
getAttachment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`digest`: Attachment digest (as found in document `_attachments`
metadata.)

Requests the body of an attachment, given its digest. This is called by
the recipient of a `rev` message if it determines that the revision
contains an attachment whose contents it does not know.

If the server's database has per-document access control, where
documents may be readable by some but not all users, it MUST check that
an attachment with this digest appears in at least one document that the
client has access to. Otherwise a client could violate access control by
getting the body of any attachment it can learn the digest of (probably
"leaked" by another user who does have access to it.) The simplest way
to enforce this is for the server to keep track of which `rev` messages
it's sent to the client but not yet received responses to; these are the
ones that the client will be requesting attachments of, to complete its
downloads.

(This request is problematic -- it assumes that the recipient indexes
attachments by digest, which is true of Couchbase Mobile but not
necessarily of other implementations. Adding the document and revision
ID to the properties would help.)

Response:

Body: raw contents of attachment

[[proveattachment]]
proveAttachment
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

`digest`: Attachment digest (as found in document `_attachments`
metadata.) +
Body: A _nonce_: 16 to 255 bytes of random binary data

Asks the recipient to prove that it has the body of the attachment with
the given digest, without making it actually send the data. This is
another security precaution that SHOULD used by servers with
per-document access control, i.e. where documents may be readable by
some but not all users. If this weren't in place, a user who knew the
digest (but not the contents) of an an attachment could upload a
document containing the metadata of an attachment with the same digest,
and then immediately download the document and the attachment.

Such a server SHOULD send this request when it receives a `rev` message
containing an attachment digest that matches an attachment it already
has. The server first generates some cryptographically-random bytes (20
is a reasonable number) as a `nonce`, and sends the nonce along with the
attachment's digest in a `proveattach` request to the client.

The recipient (the client, the one trying to push the revision) computes
a SHA-1 digest of the concatenation of the following:

1.  The length of the nonce (a single byte)
2.  The nonce itself
3.  The entire body of the attachment

It then sends a response containing the resulting digest, in the same
encoding used for attachment digests: "sha1-" followed by lowercase hex
digits.

(Meanwhile, the paranoid server performs the same computation using its
own copy of the attachment. It then verifies that the digest received
from the client matches the digest it computed. If it doesn't match, the
server can assume the client doesn't really have the attachment, and can
reject the `rev` message with the revision containing it.)

[[algorithm]]
4. Algorithm
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here are informal descriptions of the flow of control of both push and
pull replication. Note the symmetry: a lot of the steps are the same in
both lists but with "client" and "server" swapped.

[[push]]
Push
^^^^

1.  Client opens connection to server and authenticates
2.  Client sends `getCheckpoint` to verify checkpoint status
3.  Client sends one or more `changes` messages containing revisions
added since the checkpointed local sequence
* If response is a BLIP/409 or HTTP/409 error, client infers that the
server is in "no conflicts" mode, and switches to sending
`proposeChanges` messages, including resending the failed one.
* Client keeps track of how many `changes` messages have been sent but
not yet responded to
* If that count exceeds a reasonable limit, the client waits to send the
next message until a response is received.
4.  Server replies to each `changes` message indicating which revisions
it wants and which ancestors it already has
* If server is in "no conflicts" mode, it will reject `changes` messages
with a BLIP/409 or HTTP/409 error, and instead accept `proposeChanges`
messages.
5.  For each requested revision:
1.  Client sends document body in a `rev` message
2.  Server looks at each newly-added attachment digest in each revision
and
* sends a `getAttachment` for each attachment it doesn't have; client
sends data
* sends a `proveAttachment` for each attachment it already has; client
sends proof
3.  Server adds revision & attachments to database, and sends success
response to the client's `rev` message.
6.  Client periodically sends `setCheckpoint` as progress updates
7.  When all revisions and attachments have been sent, client either
disconnects (non-continuous mode) or stays connected and watches for
local doc changes, returning to step 3 when changes occur

^^^^

1.  Client opens connection to server and authenticates
2.  Client sends `getCheckpoint` to verify checkpoint status
3.  Client sends a `subChanges` message with the latest remote sequence
ID it's received in the past, and a `continuous` property if it wants to
pull continuously
4.  Server sends one or more `changes` messages containing revisions
added since the checkpointed remote sequence
* Server keeps track of how many `changes` messages have been sent but
not yet responded to
* If that count exceeds a reasonable limit, the server waits to send the
next message until a response is received.
5.  Client replies to each `changes` message indicating which revisions
it wants and which ancestors it already has
6.  For each requested revision:
1.  Server sends document body in a `rev` message
2.  Client looks at each newly-added attachment digest in each revision
and sends a `getAttachment` for each attachment it doesn't have; server
sends data
3.  Client adds revision & attachments to database, and sends success
response to the server's `rev` message.
7.  Client periodically sends `setCheckpoint` as progress updates
8.  When there are no more changes, server sends a `changes` message
with an empty list
9.  Client in non-continuous mode disconnects now that it's caught up;
client in continuous mode keeps listening
10. Server in continuous mode watches for local doc changes, returning
to step 4 when changes occur
