    /** A thread-safe collection meant for use in implementing the Observer or Publish/Subscribe pattern.

        Its key feature is that _it is safe to mutate the collection during iteration_ -- a situation that commonly
        occurs when a publisher is notifying its subscribers, and one of the subscribers calls back into
        the publisher to remove itself.

        In addition, it is guaranteed that _once an item has been removed, it will not be found by an iterator_.
        (This is a problem with the easy approach of copying the subscriber list before iterating: another thread
        might remove a subscriber and delete it, and then the iterator can call into a deleted object. Even if the
        subscriber isn't deleted, it may not expect to be called anymore which could lead to undefined behavior.) */
