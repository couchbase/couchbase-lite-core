     *  through GCD enqueue calls.  The way it works is as follows, and is common between both
     *  GCD and threaded mailbox:
     *
     *  1. On the initial call to enqueue, or enqueueAfter, a thread local manifest is checked for existence.
     *  =====
     *  2. The manifest does not exist, and it is created and captured by the block that will run inside the mailbox
     *  3. Inside the block, the thread local manifest is set to the captured manifest, so that any calls to enqueue
     *     or enqueueAfter that occur as the result of the block will notice the manifest in step 1
     *  =====
     *  2. The manifest exists, and is saved in a local variable and captured by the block that will run inside the mailbox
     *  3. Inside the block, the thread local manifest is set to the captured manifest (see reasons in alternate step 3 above)
     *  =====
     *  4. After the block is finished, the thread local manifest is cleared so that only truly nested calls are recorded.
     *     Subsequent enqueues will start a new manifest
