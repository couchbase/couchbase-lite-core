    /** A compressed revision ID. 
        Since this is based on slice, it doesn't own the memory it points to.

        There are two types of revision IDs: digests and versions.

        **Digest form** is/was used by the revision-tree versioning system in Couchbase Mobile 1 and 2.
        It consists of a generation count and an MD5 or SHA-1 digest.
        - The ASCII form looks like "123-cafebabedeadbeefdeadfade".
        - The binary form consists of the generation as a varint, followed by the digest as raw binary.

        **Version form** is used by the version-vector system in [the upcoming] Couchbase Mobile 3.
        It consists of a generation count and an integer "source ID" (or "peer ID".) The source ID zero is
        reserved to mean "the local device/database".
        - The ASCII form looks like "7b@cafebabe" -- note that the generation is hex, not decimal!
          The source ID zero is represented as a '*' character, e.g. "7b-*".
        - The binary form consists of a zero byte, the generation as a varint, and the source as a varint.
          (The leading zero is to distinguish it from the digest form.)
        The version form is also represented by the `Version` class.

        PLEASE NOTE: A revid in version form can store an entire version vector, since that format just
        consists of multiple binary versions concatenated. HOWEVER, the `revid` API only gives information
        about the first (current) version in the vector, except for the `asVersionVector` method. */
