#  `vector_search` files

These source files are copied from the private [vectorsearch][VECTORSEARCH] repo.

Using the same source code ensures that vector index parameters stay compatible, are validated consistently, and are communicated correctly from CBL to the `vectorsearch` virtual table.

Any changes made in either repo should be copied to the other!
