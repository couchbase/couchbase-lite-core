# Release Notes

## JNI Refactor
The glue code that exposes CB-Lite-Core functionalty to Java has been moved
out of this project and into [couchbase-lite-android](https://github.com/couchbase/couchbase-lite-android). 
Everything that used to be in the directory `$projectRoot/Java` has been moved to that project.
