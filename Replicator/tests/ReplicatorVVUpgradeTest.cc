/* FIXME: This test is disabled because it exposes a design issue with version vector upgrades
    and P2P replication. I need more time to think about a proper fix.

    The scenario is:
    - Database A pushes docs to peer B. Both are still on rev-trees.
    - A and B both upgrade to version vectors.
    - A updates one of the docs it pushed.
    - A pushes to B again.
    This should succeed, but instead B reports a conflict.

    In database A, when the doc is upgraded by the replicator its version vector looks like
    (`yyyy@AAAA`, xxxx@?), where `AAAA` is database A's UUID and `?` is the generic "pre-existing rev"
    UUID. That's because database A knows the first revision exists elsewhere (it's marked with
    the "remote #1" marker), while the second revision doesn't.

    However, in database B, the doc's version vector is (`xxxx@BBBB`). That's because database B
    doesn't remember that the revision came from elsewhere. When a passive replicator saves
    incoming revisions, it doesn't have a remote-ID to tag them with. That hasn't been an issue,
    until now.

    So the upshot is that the version vector A sends conflicts with the version vector B has.
    B sees that it has a version from AAAA, but is missing the version from BBBB.
